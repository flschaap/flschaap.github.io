/* LOADING */

// here we're adding some feedback to indicate when the audio is loading - this is pretty similar to our last experiement in that we're 
// applying an animation via a class. the real difference here is when that class gets added - by listening for the waiting event which 
// fires when the media is waiting to load we can add the animation to the timeline via the .classList.add() method. when we want to 
// stop the animation we listen for the canplay event which fires when the media player has buffered enough data to be able to playback the 
// media then we use the .classList.remove() method - if we instead wanted to wait until it has actually loaded the whole file we could 
// use the canplaythrough event

/* PLAY/PAUSE */

// we can use the .play() and .pause() methods on our media element to play and pause playback - because I want this to be triggered by 
// two different events (see below) i'm going to write it as a seperate function 
// by combining play and pause into the same function i'm able to make sure it does what i want - if the media is already playing i only 
// ever want use .pause() (as pausing an already paused audio doesn't really make sense) 
// the same goes if the media is paused or stopped i only want use .play()
function playPause(){
  if (audioElement.paused || audioElement.ended) {
    audioElement.play();

heroImage.addEventListener('click', playPause);

// Because the context of the media player is for it to be used for studying and/or relaxing, an image can be distracting. Therefor, 
// a focus mode button has been added. The user has the ability to change to focus mode which will hide the image and will only display the controls

/* TIMELINE */

// there's two different things we want to do with our timeline - update the progress bar to display how much has already played and let the user 
// click the progress bar to scrub the audio to a specific place in the audio
// to update the progress bar we need to listen for the timeupdate event which is fired everytime the current audio time is updated - when the audio 
// is playing this repeatedly fires at a constant rate
audioElement.addEventListener('timeupdate', () => {
  // this statement is simple - we update the progress bar's value attribute with the currentTime property of the audio, because timeupdate runs everytime
  // currentTime is changed it'll update both as the audio plays and if we were to skip or stop the audio
  progressBar.value = audioElement.currentTime;
});

// the simplest version of scrubbing would be to update the audio's currentTime when the user clicks the timeline - however due to the interaction pattern 
// established by youtube we should also account for a slightly different expression of user agency. the code below will work with a simple click on the 
// timeline but will also allow for a user to drag their mouse on the timeline to continuously update currentTime and only end scrubbing when they release the 
// mouse button. implementing this will take some more complex use of event listeners but i'll do my best to explain the design and technical implementation

// first thing we want to do is write a function that will take the current position of the the mouse in relation to the timeline and use it to change the 
// currentTime property of the audio element. each time this runs we'll need to know the position of the mouse so which we'll do using the event passed to it 
// by the eventlistener - to access this we need to set it as a parameter, i've used the name e but it can be called whatever you like
function scrubToTime(e){
  // this statement has a lot going on so let's step through each part:
  // the first thing we want to work out is the distance between the left side of the progress bar and the mouses current position - if we were just building 
  // an interaction to work when the mouse is over the bar we could take this from the event, however as we want this to also work when we've held the mouse 
  // down and moved it somewhere else on the page we need to work this out manually
  // e.clientX is the cursors current distance from the left edge of the page
  // we then want to minus (progressBar.getBoundingClientRect().left + window.scrollX) from this distance to account for any gap between the left edge of the 
  // page and the start of the progress bar
  // audioElement.currentTime is the current position in the media file - we are setting it here to change the playback time
  // we then need to find a normalised 0-1 value based on how far along the bar the cursor is - the idea is that if i click the left most side it should return 0
  // and if i click the right most side it should return 1 - we get this value by dividing x by the total width of the progressBar
  // the value is then fed into our clampZeroOne() function - this is accounting for if our mouse is further left or further right than the ends of the progress bar
  // it works by essentially making the value always equal 1 if it is over 1 or always making it 0 if under 0 - this is commonly called a clamp, we're only allowing
  // a value to be in a certain range
  // finally we're using this clamped value to multiply with total duration of our audio thus working out where we should scrub to
  let x = e.clientX - (progressBar.getBoundingClientRect().left + window.scrollX);
  audioElement.currentTime = clampZeroOne(x / progressBar.offsetWidth) * audioElement.duration;
}

// the click event fires only if the user presses the mouse down and then releases it on the same element. we can allow for a wider range of interactions by
// further breaking this down this into its discrete parts and listening to both the mousedown and mouseup events seperately

progressBar.addEventListener('mousedown', scrubToTime);
progressBar.addEventListener('mousedown', (e) => {
  // the behaviour here is to listen to the mousemove event (fired when the user moves their mouse) when the click is held down but then to stop listening to that 
  // event when the mouse click is released
  window.addEventListener('mousemove', scrubToTime);
  window.addEventListener('mouseup', () => {
    window.removeEventListener('mousemove', scrubToTime);
  });
