	<h2>1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h2>
	<p>The jittering "Explore me" button and the header that appeared after clicking that button, as the movements caught my eyes.</p>
	
	<h2>2. A list of discrete actions</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Press "Explore me" button</li>
		<li>Click on "Portfolio"</li>
		<li>Scroll down to see how many projects there are</li>
		<li>Click on the "CSS" button to see CSS projects (but this actually eliminated all the CSS projects)</li>
		<li>Click all the other categories to see only the CSS projects</li>
		<li>Click on the first project</li>
		<li>Go back to the home page</li>
		<li>Go to the "About & Skills" page</li>
		<li>Go back to the home page</li>
		<li>Try to scroll down as the red line made me think that was a possibility</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2>3. What part of the experience did I spend most time engaging with?</h2>
	<p>I spent the most time clicking on and reading about the different projects.</p>
	
	<h2>4. What was the most common interaction?</h2>
	<p>The most common interaction I had with the page was opening and closing the project tabs.</p>
	
	<h2>5. What is my impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h2>
	<p>I am under the impression that the primary goal of the page is to inform clients and/or assessors about the work by showcasing different projects. Next to that, I believe Ritwick is using the experience itself to display his skills as well.</p>
	
	<h2>6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?</h2>
	<p>I was directed to the projects page almost immediately, and it displayed the projects in an organized and inviting way.</p>
	
	<h2>7. What is my impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time?</h2>
	<p>My impression is that the live projects should be viewed, and that the code should be looked at by those interested.</p>
	
	<h2>8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over time?</h2>
	<p>The experience leads you to the project page and implies that more details can be viewed when you click on the projects.</p>
	
	<h2>9. What other media forms does the experience reference?</h2>
	<p>The experience guides users to project links (containing the code), live URLs, and references to used platforms.</p>
	
	<h2>10. What does this reference communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with the research experience?</h2>
	<p>This communicates that I should follow the links to these media forms and view their content.</p>
	
	<h2>11. What does this reference communicate to you about how you should feel when engaging with your research experience?</h2>
	<p>It communicates that I should feel impressed by the amount of work Ritwick has done.</p>
	
	<h2>12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you, and what makes that part frustrating?</h2>
	<p>Due to the restless way the text "Explore me" was moving, all my attention went to this and evoked me to click on them as soon as possible to stop the moving, which prevented me from looking at other parts of the page.</p>
	
	<h2>13. What is the most satisfying part of the interaction, and what makes that part satisfying?</h2>
	<p>The structured way in which the projects are displayed and the way the pages flow from one to another so smoothly due to the design I found the most satisfying.</p>
