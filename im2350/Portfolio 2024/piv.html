<h2>Vision</h2>

<p>
    Within design, I care about a set of relationships. These are the relationships between people and artefacts, between people and nature, and interpersonal relationships. 
When I talk about the relationship between people and artefacts, I see more-than-human design as an outcome to foster such relationships (Wakkary, 2021). In Western societies, there is often no enduring relationship between users and their products, leading to a “throw-away society” that causes pollution and exploitation of natural resources (McCollough, 2012). I believe design can restore and strengthen the attachment people have to their products, for example done in the Long Living Chair that was inspired by slow design (Pschetz, 2013), fostering preservation over disposal. Indigenous designers, for instance, imbue their artefacts with stories and spirits, creating a preciousness that Western cultures have lost (Page, 2021).
In relation to nature, modern Western societies often view it as an inexhaustible resource to be exploited. Ingold’s concept of “Bringing Things Back to Life” emphasizes the dynamic and ongoing entanglements between materials, makers, and users (Ingold, 2013). Design, in this sense, becomes a process of continuous engagement with the material world. Views like this can shift design towards being a more sustainable practice. Escobar's "Designs for the Pluriverse" advocates for a pluriversal approach that respects diverse ways of living and interacting with the environment (Escobar, 2018). My experiences studying intercultural communication and learning about Australian Indigenous communities have shown me the importance of these diverse perspectives.
Therefor, interpersonal relationships are also central to my design philosophy. Design can facilitate meaningful interactions and strengthen community bonds. By integrating cultural narratives and promoting collaborative creation, designers can bridge cultural divides and enhance social cohesion. 
Ultimately, my vision for design is to create artefacts that not only serve functional purposes but also nurture the relationships between people, artefacts, and the natural world. By adopting a humble, responsive, and ethical approach to design, I aim to contribute to a more sustainable and inclusive future, where diverse cultural perspectives are valued and integrated into our everyday lives. Design, when applied thoughtfully, has the power to transform these relationships and create a more harmonious and resilient world.

<h2>Professional Identity</h2>

<p>
    As a designer, I aim to take human perspectives and societal issues into account while designing with and for people. This means I am intrigued to research underlying philosophical questions such as what the ethical responsibilities of designers are or what a "positive impact on society" means in the context of design. Addressing these questions ensures that I approach projects with an ethical and holistic mindset, trying to reveal underlying issues that may not be as apparent. For example, the issue of over consumption is not just a result of people not caring, but comes from product-disposing habits, and norms and values that are deeply rooted within societies. 
    To balance out the time I spend pondering these foundational questions, I aim to focus on human perspectives by co-creating and engaging with peoples different perspectives throughout the entire design process. This type of interaction also provides an endless source of fresh views and insights, enriching the design process. 
    To support the process of connecting people, artefacts and the environment, I strive to create prototypes that evoke unexpected responses and insights. Prototyping is a great way to spark conversations and imagination, so I implement this in my process as much as possible. In the spirit of sparking imagination; I often have a tendency to create what I like to call an ‘organised mess’ as this helps me with the process of detangling complexity. This way I embrace experimentation and exploration, leaving visible traces along the way, so that I can uncover new possibilities. This does backfire at some points. When having a structured approach is expected and it comes to deadlines, I find it difficult to commit to certain ideas as I would rather stay in an explorative phase.  
    In summary, my approach to design is rooted in the understanding and curiosity of human perspectives and societal issues. By addressing philosophical questions, engaging with users, and creating provocative prototypes, I strive to restore the imbalance interpersonal relationships, and relationships between people, nature, and artifacts.
